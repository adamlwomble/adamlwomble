        <p>ParcelShield offered logistics customers uncommon solutions to common problems: package intervention services, carrier performance analytics, and predictive shipment planning. ParcelShield’s problem was not a lack of ability — it was a lack of harmony; after years of product expansions, its services were distributed across disparate legacy applications. The various applications had variant esthetics, which produced discordant user experiences; divergent vocabularies across applications exacerbated inconsonant experiences as internal and external users’ cognitive loads were overburdened. We needed a return to the first principles of systematic design and sustainable development.</p>
        <p>As the Lead UX Designer I collaborated with leaders across business and engineering domains to gather requirements, plan journeys, and develop strategies for a harmonized platform. We achieved visual congruity through reusable components, enabled intellectual concord through a controlled vocabulary, and delivered a unified product through consistent interaction patterns leveraging both.</p>
<p>As the Lead Front-end Developer, I cooperated with the back-end team to build a new front-end application in Angular and TypeScript (TS). I introduced functional composability through declarative patterns, emphasized resilient interfaces through predictable application programming interfaces (APIs), and deployed a cogent platform through consistent development practices.</p>
<p>As ParcelShield sought to expand its product offerings with logistics planning powered by artificial intelligence, I oversaw the development of a new front-end application in React and TS. Using the same first principles of design and development, we realized a compelling product expansion with rich visualizations and insightful suggestions.</p>

                <p>With expanding business functions and a diverse team, Nexus Cognitive needed a trusted manager to lead the delivery efforts of an anchor project. Simultaneously, the business staff for the eCommerce platform of the largest non-profit, educational, and governmental purchasing cooperative in the United States struggled to support the unprecedented growth in revenues and collections through legacy technologies and processes.</p>
<p>As Product Team Lead, I guided group design sessions with key stakeholders across business functions to gather requirements and orchestrate processes for diversified business functions such as online shopping, account reconciliation, and payment processing. With the outcomes of group design sessions, I partner with the Product Owner and Managing Director to plan, populate, and prioritize
the product backlog in Azure DevOps.</p>
<p>Once we groomed the product backlog, I shepherded the design and development of features across diverse technologies: CSS, HTML, JS, and Vue.js for the front-end; C# and .Net for the back-end; and Structured Query Language (SQL) and SQL Server for the database. While overseeing the delivery of sprint priorities in an agile process, I communicated delivery progress with executive stakeholders to secure a shared understanding of application evolution.</p>

                <p>As Lead UX Designer, I pioneered the experiential direction of the eCommerce platform for the largest governmental, educational, and non-profit purchasing cooperative in the United States. Working alongside key stakeholders on extremely tight deadlines, I gathered business requirements and redefined business processes to drive platform revenue to a new record beyond $1.5B.</p>
<p>We needed to enable extreme developer productivity and rebuild the web application from scratch in six months. To satisfy that need as the Lead Front-end Developer, I drove the adoption of Vue.js as our JS framework while leading training sessions with the team to demonstrate principles and patterns of practice across CSS, HTML, JS, and Vue.js technologies.</p>
